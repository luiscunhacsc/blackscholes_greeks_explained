    ## Black-Scholes Model: Mathematical Foundation
    
    ### Model Overview
    The Black-Scholes model prices European options using these key assumptions:
    1. No arbitrage opportunities
    2. Constant volatility (œÉ) and risk-free rate (r)
    3. No transaction costs or dividends
    4. Underlying follows geometric Brownian motion
    
    ### Core Equations
    
    **Black-Scholes PDE**:
    $$
    \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2S^2\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + rS\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - rV = 0
    $$
    
    **Closed-Form Solution** (for European options):
    $$
    C(S,t) = N(d_1)S - N(d_2)Ke^{-r(T-t)}
    $$
    $$
    P(S,t) = N(-d_2)Ke^{-r(T-t)} - N(-d_1)S
    $$
    
    Where:
    $$
    d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S/K) + (r + \\sigma^2/2)(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}
    $$
    $$
    d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}
    $$
    
    ### Greeks in Mathematical Form
    
    | Greek  | Call Option Formula                      | Put Option Formula                       |
    |--------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | Delta  | $N(d_1)$                                 | $N(d_1) - 1$                             |
    | Gamma  | $\\frac{N'(d_1)}{S\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$   | Same as Call                             |
    | Theta  | $-\\frac{S N'(d_1)\\sigma}{2\\sqrt{T-t}} - rKe^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$ | $-\\frac{S N'(d_1)\\sigma}{2\\sqrt{T-t}} + rKe^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_2)$ |
    | Vega   | $S N'(d_1)\\sqrt{T-t}$                   | Same as Call                             |
    | Rho    | $K(T-t)e^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)$                | $-K(T-t)e^{-r(T-t)}N(-d_2)$              |

    ### Connecting Theory to Practice
    
    1. **See Equations in Action**:
       - Use the interactive tool to observe how changing:
         - $S$ affects $d_1$ and Delta
         - $\\sigma$ modifies the probability distribution (Vega)
         - $T$ impacts time decay patterns (Theta)
    
    2. **Model Limitations**:
       - Assumes constant volatility (vs real-world stochastic vol)
       - No early exercise (American options)
       - Log-normal distribution may not match market returns
    
    3. **Empirical Testing**:
       - Try extreme parameters (œÉ=100%, T=0.01 years) to see model boundaries
       - Compare ITM/OTM Greeks to understand probability weightings

        **Observe Delta as Probability**:

        **Real-World Scenario:**  
        You're a portfolio manager holding **100 call options** during earnings season. The stock is **highly volatile**.  
        Your goal is to **stay delta-neutral**, meaning that the overall portfolio (options + shares) has a net Delta near zero. 
        This helps you avoid large directional gains or losses if the stock moves suddenly.

        ---
        **Beginner Explanation of What's Happening:**

        - **Call Options**: Owning a call gives you positive Delta (usually between 0 and 1 per contract). 
          For example, if one call has Œî=0.50, holding 100 calls gives a total Delta of 50 (0.50 √ó 100).

        - **Owning vs. Shorting Shares**: 
          - If your net Delta is +50, you can **short 50 shares** to bring total Delta to zero. 
          - If the stock price rises, your short shares lose money but the calls gain value‚Äîideally canceling out.

        - **Why Hedge?**  
          - Delta-hedging removes immediate exposure to price moves, letting you potentially profit from other factors 
            (like time decay or changes in volatility).  
          - As the stock price changes, Delta changes too, so you must **rebalance** your share position periodically 
            (dynamic hedging).

        **Learning Objective:**  
        - Understand how **Delta** acts as a hedge ratio.
        - Practice adjusting your share position to keep the overall Delta near zero.

        ---
        **Suggested Steps**:
        1. Click "**Set Lab 1 Parameters**" to use S=100, K=100, T=1 month, œÉ=40%, r=2%.
        2. Look at the **Delta** displayed in the main tool tab.  
           Holding 100 calls ‚Üí net Delta = 100 √ó (option's Œî).  
        3. If the stock jumps to S=105, see how Œî changes.  
        4. Recalculate how many shares to short:  
           `Shares Needed = - (New Delta) √ó (Number of Contracts)`.
        5. Repeat as the stock moves around and observe how often you might rebalance.

        **üí° Reflection Questions:**  
        - Why do ATM calls typically have Œî around 0.5?  
        - How does a higher œÉ (volatility) affect how quickly Œî changes (i.e., Gamma)?  
        - What happens to Œî and Gamma as expiration approaches?

        that can be **profitable** if you rebalance your share position frequently. This is known as 
        **Gamma scalping** or **Gamma trading**.

        **Learning Objective:**  
        - Observe how **Gamma** is the rate of change of Delta with respect to the underlying price.
        - Understand why having large Gamma can help you profit from volatility if you actively manage your Delta.

        **Suggested Steps**:
        1. Click "**Set Lab 2 Parameters**" to pick an ATM strike, T=6 months, œÉ=40%.
        2. Go to the main tool tab and note the **Gamma**. 
        3. Move the **Stock Price (S)** slider around 90‚Äì110. Watch how Delta changes.
        4. Think about how you'd buy low and sell high in the underlying shares each time 
           Delta changes to lock in small gains.

        **Key Insight**:  
        - **High Gamma** ‚Üí Delta changes quickly with small price moves ‚Üí more frequent rebalancing opportunities 
          ‚Üí potential to "scalp" the market if realized volatility is high enough.

        **üí° Reflection Questions:**  
        - How does Gamma behave as your option goes deeper ITM or OTM?  
        - Why is Gamma typically **highest near-the-money** and **near expiration**?

        **Learning Objective:**  
        - Investigate how **Theta** (daily time decay) behaves for near-expiration options.
        - Compare it against the risk of big adverse moves (Gamma risk).

        - Option sellers can profit from this, but face a high Gamma risk if the stock swings around.

        **üí° Reflection Questions:**

    ### 1. What Are Options?

    **Options** are **contracts** that let you "lock in" a price to **buy** or **sell** a stock, 
    without forcing you to actually do it. Think of them like a **reservation**:
    - A **Call Option** is a reservation to **buy** a stock at a certain *strike price* before the option expires.
    - A **Put Option** is a reservation to **sell** a stock at a certain *strike price* before the option expires.

    If it ends up being a good deal (e.g., the stock price goes above your call's strike), 
    you can use your option ("exercise" it). If not, you can simply let it expire. 
    You **never** have to use your reservation.

    ---

    ### 2. Why Do People Use Options?

    1. **To Potentially Profit If the Market Moves**  
       - If you think a stock will go **up**, you might **buy a call**. 
         When the stock does rise above your strike, your option can become **very valuable**.
       - If you think it'll go **down**, you might **buy a put**. 
         If the stock price falls below your put's strike, you can sell at that higher fixed price.

    2. **To Protect Existing Stocks (Hedging)**  
       - If you **already own** shares and worry about a drop in price, 
         you can buy a **put** as insurance. If the stock falls a lot, 
         your put can offset some of the losses.

    3. **To Earn Income**  
       - Some people **sell** options (like selling insurance). 
         They collect money upfront (the premium), but if the market moves 
         strongly in the buyer's favor, the seller has significant risk.

    ---

    ### 3. A Simple Example

    - **Buying a Call** on a stock at ‚Ç¨100 (strike) for a ‚Ç¨2 premium:
      - If the stock price goes to ‚Ç¨110, you can buy it at ‚Ç¨100 using your call 
        and potentially sell it at ‚Ç¨110 in the market. That could yield a profit 
        (minus the ‚Ç¨2 you paid).
      - If the stock never goes above ‚Ç¨100, you won't use your call. 
        You just lose the ‚Ç¨2 you paid.

    This is similar to paying for a ticket that might be valuable later if conditions are right.

    ---

    ### 4. How People Trade Options on a Broker Platform

    1. **Pick a Stock** (e.g., Apple).
    2. **Select an Expiration Date** (maybe 1 month or 6 months from now).
    3. **Choose a Strike Price** (the price you're locking in).
    4. **Choose Call or Put** (buy or sell):
       - **Buy a Call**: You pay the premium to have the right to buy the stock.
       - **Buy a Put**: You pay the premium to have the right to sell the stock.
       - **Sell a Call/Put**: You collect the premium but take on the obligation 
         if the buyer exercises their right.

    Once you confirm, your broker shows your option position in your account. 
    The value of that position changes day by day, based on:
    - The stock‚Äôs price changing,
    - Time passing (options lose value as they get closer to expiration, all else equal),
    - Changes in market volatility (bigger expected swings often make options more expensive).

    ---

    ### 5. What Is the Black-Scholes Model?

    This is a **mathematical formula** to figure out a "fair" price for an option, 
    assuming you know:
    - How volatile the stock is (œÉ),
    - How much time remains (T),
    - What the stock price (S) and strike (K) are,
    - The risk-free interest rate (r).

    Professionals use this model to **estimate** how much an option should cost 
    and to see how sensitive it is to changes in the stock price or volatility.

    ---

    ### 6. Understanding "Delta Hedging" (An Advanced, But Important Idea)

    - **Delta** is just a number that tells you **how much** an option's price might 
      change if the stock moves by ‚Ç¨1.
    - For example, if a call has a Delta of 0.50, that means if the stock price goes up by ‚Ç¨1, 
      the call might increase by about ‚Ç¨0.50.

    **Delta hedging** means:
    1. You figure out your total Delta. 
       - For instance, if you own 2 call options (each covering 100 shares) 
         and each has Delta = 0.50, your total Delta is 0.50 √ó 200 = 100. 
         (It's as if you own 100 shares.)
    2. If you **don‚Äôt** want to be exposed to big stock moves, you can **short 100 shares** 
       (i.e., borrow shares and sell them). 
       - This way, if the stock price goes up, you **lose** on the short shares but **gain** on the calls, 
         roughly canceling out.
    3. If the stock price goes down, your calls lose some value, but the short shares gain.
    4. Because Delta changes as the stock price moves (Gamma effect), professionals keep **rebalancing**. 
       This is **dynamic hedging**‚Äîthey‚Äôre constantly adjusting how many shares they hold short (or long).

    **Why do it?**  
    - Professionals often want to earn money from **time decay** or changes in volatility, 
      rather than guessing whether a stock goes up or down. By hedging Delta, 
      they remove the "directional" risk.

    ---

    ### 7. What Professional Investors Do

    1. **Hedging a Portfolio**: 
       If a big fund owns many stocks, it might buy puts for protection, 
       or it might use Delta hedging to keep overall risk manageable.
    2. **Speculating (Directional Bets)**: 
       If they strongly believe a stock will rise, 
       they might buy calls to amplify potential gains with less initial cash outlay.
    3. **Collecting Premiums (Selling Options)**: 
       Some funds or traders sell options regularly, aiming to profit from the "time decay" 
       if prices don‚Äôt move dramatically.

    ---

    ### 8. Key Takeaways (No Jargon)

    - **Options** let you fix a buy or sell price in the future, but you only exercise if it benefits you.
    - **Call** = right to buy; **Put** = right to sell.
    - **Black-Scholes** is a famous formula to help price options and understand their risk.
    - **Delta Hedging** is when you buy or sell shares to **balance out** (hedge) the effect of price moves on your option position.
    - **Even professionals** find it difficult to beat a diversified index fund consistently.
    - **Professional Investors** often combine options with shares to manage risk or speculate, 
      adjusting positions (sometimes daily) to keep their profits and losses more predictable.
